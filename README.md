The purpose of this project tracks each asset account at supply costs in manufacturing and construction industries with asset depreciation value and verify a total cost of each asset account.    

Data Explanation:
This project design only utilizes “some elements of asset account” process in Oracle and SAP suites based on my previous process experience in asset account. 
However, if it is a different business industry asset account setup in the real-time working system, I will need to write different syntax (programming language)
depending on that the working asset account information structure for extraction to the target data.
In a particular case, Python. NumPy can effectively verify financial statements with the ending total balance by using the Math calculation method.
 
 
 Thank you so much for your review. I welcome any questions for further development.
