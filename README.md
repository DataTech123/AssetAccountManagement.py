This project uses software (Python and Visual Studio Code) to write code based on partial elements of the asset account information structure in the asset service module of Oracle's PeopleSoft accounting system. The purpose of this project tracks each asset account's material cost in construction projects, including asset depreciation value, net book value, and verifying a total cost of each asset account.

Data Explanation:
This project design utilizes only certain elements of each asset account to display Asset 1 through Asset 5 and Asset ID (example asset illustration) in Oracle's PeopleSoft. Based on my work experience in the Department of Seattle City Light, asset account uses a digit-based number to represent the asset and the asset account code.

If Oracle recently upgrades its PeopleSoft asset accounting system, the upgraded system will rely on the actual working system configuration to view the database diagram to fetch the target data by writing different code.

 
 Thank you so much for your review. I welcome any questions for further development.
